The objective of this course is to introduce graduate students to a variety of multivariate statistical techniques and methods to enable them to effectively carry out an empirical research study in management including the business, public, and not-for-profit sectors. Topics include: introduction to research design and multivariate methods, linear regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance and covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis, principal components analysis, common factor analysis, and additional multivariate topics if time permits. The technical level of treatment would require basic understanding of matrix and linear algebra and at least one first level course in statistics. Such preliminary technical understanding will be helpful to appreciate the theory and intuition behind the multivariate techniques. A good blend of technical, conceptual, and practical aspects (using SPSS software) of the course will be maintained.</fulldesc><hours>H(3-0)</hours><prereqs>Consent of the Haskayne School of Business.</prereqs><coreqs></coreqs><antireq></antireq><notes></notes><aka></aka><repeat></repeat><nogpa></nogpa></course>
